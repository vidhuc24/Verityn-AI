Task 7: Simplified Performance Assessment - Core Metrics Comparison

This script implements a simplified performance assessment focusing on core metrics
to compare naive vs advanced retrieval techniques in our multi-agent system.

Deliverables:
1. Compare performance using core metrics and quantify improvements
2. Articulate expected changes for second half of course

                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                This quarterly user access review evaluated 1,247 user accounts across financial systems 
                for Uber Technologies. The review was conducted in accordance with SOX 404 requirements
                and identified no material weaknesses.
                
                SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
                The access review covered all users with access to financial systems including:
                - SAP Financial Module (847 users)
                - Oracle Procurement System (312 users)  
                - Expense Management Platform (623 users)
                
                KEY FINDINGS
                1. All user access is properly authorized and documented
                2. Segregation of duties is maintained across all critical processes
                3. Quarterly access certification completed with 100% response rate
                4. No terminated employees found with active system access
                
                MANAGEMENT RESPONSE
                Management is satisfied with the current access control environment.
                No remediation actions are required at this time.

                This report documents the month-end financial reconciliation process for all general ledger accounts.
                Several discrepancies were identified that require management attention.
                
                DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED
                1. Bank reconciliation variance: $47,823 (unreconciled items over 30 days)
                2. Accounts receivable aging discrepancy: $12,450
                3. Inventory count variance: $8,920
                4. Prepaid expenses allocation error: $3,200
                
                MATERIAL WEAKNESS ASSESSMENT
                The volume and nature of reconciliation discrepancies indicate a MATERIAL WEAKNESS
                in the month-end close process. This represents a deficiency in internal controls.
                
                MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN
                1. Implement daily cash position monitoring
                2. Enhance AR aging review procedures  
                3. Strengthen inventory count controls
                4. Improve prepaid expense tracking

                This comprehensive IT security risk assessment evaluated cybersecurity controls

                HIGH RISK FINDINGS
                1. Privileged access management gaps - 23 admin accounts without proper oversight
                2. Multi-factor authentication not enforced for 40% of financial system users
                3. Security patch management delays averaging 45 days for critical systems
                4. Inadequate logging and monitoring for financial applications
