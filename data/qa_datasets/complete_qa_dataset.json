Additionally, implementing role-based access controls with segregation of duties matrices would prevent future violations. These improvements should be monitored through monthly control testing and quarterly management assessments.",

The segregation of duties violations could enable fraud or errors in financial processes, while excessive privileges increase the risk of unauthorized financial data modifications. If not remediated, these issues could result in management having to report material weaknesses to auditors and potentially impact the company's financial statement certifications.",
