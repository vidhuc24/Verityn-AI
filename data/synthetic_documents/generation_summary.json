Specifically, the lack of automated access removal processes and inadequate quarterly review procedures present risks to internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR).",

Assessment results show 4 high risks, 12 medium risks, and 7 low risks. The inherent risk rating is High due to transaction volume and complexity, while residual risk is Medium-Low following control implementation.",
            "methodology": "Risk assessment methodology included process walkthroughs, control testing, system analysis, and stakeholder interviews. The assessment covered all process steps from customer onboarding through revenue recording, focusing on SOX 404 control requirements and financial reporting accuracy.",

Key controls include automated system validations, multi-level approval workflows, monthly analytical reviews, and quarterly management certifications. Three controls require enhancement to address identified deficiencies.",

Operating effectiveness shows some exceptions in manual review controls and approval workflow adherence. Management has committed to addressing all identified deficiencies within the prescribed timeline.",
            "management_response": "Management response includes: (1) Enhanced system validation controls for revenue calculations, (2) Strengthened approval workflow enforcement, (3) Implementation of automated third-party reconciliation processes, (4) Additional training for manual journal entry procedures. All actions have assigned owners and target completion dates.",
            "monitoring_plan": "Ongoing monitoring includes monthly control testing, quarterly management assessments, and annual independent validation. Key performance indicators have been established to track control effectiveness and remediation progress. The Internal Audit team will conduct follow-up testing in Q2 2024."
